## MyCite
The [MYCITEÂ® App](https://www.abilifymycite.com) is part of a digital medicine system that helps you and your healthcare team stay on top of how your treatment is going.
The 3 components â€” a smart pill with sensor, a non-medicated MYCITEÂ® Patch, and the appâ€”receive and display your daily health data. Data displayed on the app include when you take your pill, your activity level, and time spent resting. It also allows you to select your mood, how well you rested, and the reason, if you didnâ€™t take your pill.
